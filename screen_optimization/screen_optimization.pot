msgid "Ren'Py uses a number of techniques to optimize screen language speed. When using Ren'Py to create complex interfaces, such as those used by simulation games, it may help to understand how screen language works so you can achieve maximal performance."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/screen_optimization.rst:15
msgid "This guide is applicable to the second implementation of screen language, which was added to Ren'Py 6.18. If your game was created in Ren'Py 6.17 or earlier, it may be necessary to chose the \"Force Recompile\" option in the launcher to ensure its screens are upgraded to the latest version."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/screen_optimization.rst:20
msgid "This guide isn't a substitute for good programming practice. If a screen uses nested loops to do a lot of unproductive work, it will be slower than a screen that avoids such looping. While understanding the techniques in this guide is important, avoiding work entirely is always better than letting Ren'Py optimize the work for you."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/screen_optimization.rst:45
msgid "When a screen is defined without a parameter list, any name used in that screen can be redefined when the screen is show. This requires Ren'Py to be more conservative when analyzing the screen, which can limit the optimization it performs."

msgid "Prediction"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/screen_optimization.rst:53
msgid "Screens perform better when they're predicted in advance. That's because Ren'Py will execute the screen during prediction time, and load in images that are used by the screen."

msgid "There are two ways Ren'Py automatically predicts screens:"

#: ../../source/screen_optimization.rst:61
msgid "Ren'Py will predict screen that will be shown by the :func:`Show` and :func:`ShowMenu` actions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/screen_optimization.rst:64
msgid "If screens are shown from Python, it's a good idea to start predicting the screen before it is shown. To start predicting a screen, use the :func:`renpy.start_predict_screen` function. To stop predicting a screen, use the :func:`renpy.stop_predict_screen` function."

msgid "Displayable Reuse"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/screen_optimization.rst:73
msgid "When evaluating a screen language statement that creates a displayable, Ren'Py will check to see if the positional arguments and properties given to that displayable are equal to the positional arguments and properties given the last time that statement was evaluated. If they are, instead of making a new displayable, Ren'Py will reuse the existing displayable."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/screen_optimization.rst:79
msgid "Displayable reuse has a number of performance implications. It saves the cost of creating a new displayable, which may be significant for displayables that contain a lot of internal state. More importantly, reusing a displayable means that in many cases, Ren'Py will not need to re-render the displayable before showing it to the user, which can lead to another significant speedup."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/screen_optimization.rst:85
msgid "To compare positional arguments and properties, Ren'Py uses the notion of equality embodied by Python's == operator. We've extended this notion of equality to actions by deciding two actions should be equal when they are indistinguishable from each other - when it doesn't matter which action is invoked, or which action is queried to determine sensitivity or selectedness."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/screen_optimization.rst:92
msgid "All actions provided with Ren'Py conform to this definition. When defining your own actions, it makes sense to provide them with this notion of equality. This can be done by supplying an appropriate ``__eq__`` method. For example::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/screen_optimization.rst:111
msgid "It's important to define the ``__eq__`` function carefully, making sure it compares all fields, and uses equality (==) and identity (is) comparison as appropriate."

msgid "An expression is **const** (short for constant) if it always represents the same value when it is evaluated. For Ren'Py's purposes, an expression is const if and only if the following expressions always evaluate to the same const value or are undefined:"

msgid "Python numbers and strings are const, as are list, tuple, set, and dict literals for which all components are const. Ren'Py marks variables defined using the ``define`` statement as const. The :func:`renpy.const` and :func:`renpy.not_const` functions can be used to further control what Ren'Py considers to be const. The default list of const names is given in the :ref:`Const Names <const-names>` section below."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/screen_optimization.rst:171
msgid "There are three advantages to ensuring that screen language arguments and properties are const."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/screen_optimization.rst:174
msgid "The first is that const arguments and properties are evaluated when screens are prepared, which is at the end of the init phase, when the language is changed, or when styles are rebuilt. After that, it is no longer necessary to spend time evaluating const arguments and properties."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/screen_optimization.rst:179
msgid "The second is that const works well with displayable reuse. When all of the arguments and properties of a displayable are const, the displayable can always be reused, which gains all the benefits of displayable reuse."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/screen_optimization.rst:183
msgid "Lastly, when Ren'Py encounters a tree of displayables such that all arguments, properties, and expressions affecting control flow are also const, Ren'Py will reuse the entire tree without evaluating expressions or creating displayables. This can yield a significant performance boost."
msgstr ""
