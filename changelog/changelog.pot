msgid "This release includes updated versions of the Tutorial game and \"The Question\", the example game that's bundled with Ren'Py."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/changelog.rst:17
msgid "The Tutorial game has been largely rewritten, and is now structured as a pair lectures, the first covering the creation of a basic visual novel in Ren'Py, and the second covering in-depth topics needed to create more advanced games. The Tutorial has also lost content that is less relevant to modern Ren'Py, focusing in on the features that are the best practice to use in new games."

#: ../../source/changelog.rst:41

This tool makes it possible to add the scene, show, hide, with, play, queue, stop, and voice statements to Ren'Py from inside an under-development visual novel, without having to change to a text editor and reload the project. The interactive director can be accessed by pressing the D key (without shift) inside an unreleased game."

#: ../../source/changelog.rst:3570
