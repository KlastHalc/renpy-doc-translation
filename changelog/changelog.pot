msgid "Ren'Py now searches for the bounding box of non-transparent pixels when converting an image into a texture. When the :var:`config.optimize_texture_bounds` variable is true (as it is by default), only the non-transparent pixels are stored in the image cache. This can massively reduce the in-memory size of certain images, such as images that correspond to mostly-transparent layers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/changelog.rst:23
msgid "The :var:`config.cache_surfaces` variable is now False by default. This halves the amount of memory required for the image cache, but may slow down multiple image manipulators applied to the same image."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/changelog.rst:27
msgid "The size of the image cache is now controlled by the :var:`config.image_cache_size_mb` variable, which defaults to 300 megabytes. With the new default settings, each pixel inside the images non-transparent bounding box takes up 4 bytes of memory."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/changelog.rst:32
msgid "The result of these three changes is that images take up less memory in cache, meaning Ren'Py can store far more predicted images."
msgstr ""

msgid "Ren'Py now refuses to call functions that read from disk (such as :func:`renpy.image_size`) when predicting images and screens, rather than risking these slow calls leading to drops in framerate."

msgid "Ren'Py has a number of options that control display performance, accessed through the shift+G menu. In addition to the GL performance change described above, this allows the player to lock the framerate and accept tearing when a frame is late. A player on a slow machine might choose to prefer 30fps to an unstable framerate. If the developer expects many players will be on slow devices, a default can be chosen with::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/changelog.rst:113
msgid "When a frame takes too long to render (say, because an unpredicted image has to be loaded from disk), Ren'Py will attempt to use the time the frame was presented as the base time for transitions and displayables. Effectively, this means that if Ren'Py has to skip frames, it'll skip them before the first frame in a sequence, rather than between the first and second frame."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/changelog.rst:119
msgid "Ren'Py itself triggers garbage collection immediately after a frame is drawn, if enough objects have been created. Outside of this collection, the number of objects required to trigger the garbage collector has been raised. The thresholds are high enough that collection should not be required if the game does not create circular object references. (That is, objects that refer to each other in a loop.) Ren'Py has been changed to eliminate common sources of circular object references."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/changelog.rst:127
msgid "For most games, Ren'Py managed garbage collection should reduce or even eliminate frame drops caused by the garbage collector. However, it is possible to revert to the previous tuning by setting :var:`config.manage_gc` to False."

msgid "By default, Ren'Py will remove transient screens (like say and choice) and displayables without triggering on \"hide\" event handlers. The process of checking  for such handlers was relatively expensive, while the use of those handlers is rare. This change can be reverted by setting :var:`config.zap_transients` to False."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/changelog.rst:138
msgid "Ren'Py will now cache compiled Python expressions the first time it encounters them, rather than compiling an expression each time it is encountered. This speeds up the overused ConditionSwitch displayable, along with other parts of Ren'Py. Because of this change, a game will open slowly the first time it's run under Ren'Py 6.99.14, as all of the expressions need to be compiled."
msgstr ""

msgid "This release both increases the speed of maintaining the information required by rollback, and does so less often. This may be visible to players by Ren'Py now allowing them to roll back farther than before."

#: ../../source/changelog.rst:310
msgid "The Tutorial game has been largely rewritten, and is now structured as a pair lectures, the first covering the creation of a basic visual novel in Ren'Py, and the second covering in-depth topics needed to create more advanced games. The Tutorial has also lost content that is less relevant to modern Ren'Py, focusing in on the features that are the best practice to use in new games."

This tool makes it possible to add the scene, show, hide, with, play, queue, stop, and voice statements to Ren'Py from inside an under-development visual novel, without having to change to a text editor and reload the project. The interactive director can be accessed by pressing the D key (without shift) inside an unreleased game."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/changelog.rst:3972
msgid "This release introduces a new screen system, which allows one to use the new screen language to declaratively specify portions of the user interface. The screen language supersedes layouts, overlay functions, imagemaps, and most other means of customizing the out-of-game menus and the in-game screens."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/changelog.rst:3977
msgid "The previous way of customizing the behavior of the game menu, the layout system, had problems, especially when using imagemap layouts. Screens were single-purpose, and it would be difficult to (for example) load a quick-save game from the main menu, without extensive Python code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/changelog.rst:3982
msgid "The screen system addresses this by providing a pool of functionality, in the form of Actions and BarValues. This makes it possible to pick and choose functionality, and add it to screens as is deemed necessary."

msgid "If a transform does not define one of the position properties :propref:`xpos`, :propref:`ypos`, :propref:`xanchor`, or :propref:`yanchor`, that property will be taken from the transform's child, if the defines that property."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/changelog.rst:3994
msgid "This makes it possible to have one transform control a displayable's vertical motion, and the other control the horizontal. But this is incompatible with previous behavior, and so can be disabled with the :var:`config.transform_uses_child_position` variable."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/changelog.rst:3999
msgid "The new config.default_transform variable allows a transform to specify the initial transform properties of an image that does not have a more specific transform applied to it. Its default value is center, a transform that shows the image at the center-bottom of the screen."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/changelog.rst:4004
msgid "This can lead to a behavior change. When an image is shown, and then shown transforms, the transform will be initialized to the bottom center of the screen, not the top-left. The reset transform can be used to reset the position to the top-left."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/changelog.rst:4009
msgid "Transform (and ui.transform) have been changed so that their arguments can now be prefixed with a style prefix. One can write ui.transform(idle_rotate=30, hover_rotate=90) and have it work."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/changelog.rst:4013
msgid "Added the rotate_pad transform property, which controls how Transform pads rotated displayables. When set to False, _not_ the default, it's now possible to rotate a (100, 50) displayable by 90 degrees, and have the result be (50, 100) in size."

msgid "area - take (x, y, height, width) pair, and tries to set properties such that the displayable will be placed inside the rectangle. This sets the xpos, ypos, xanchor, yanchor, xfill, yfill, xminimum, yminimum, xmaximum, and ymaximum properties."
